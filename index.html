          What is Minimalism ?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Minimalism is a concept that has been gaining popularity lately. And for good reason! There are many benefits of living with less. But there are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings about what a minimalist lifestyle is exactly, and what it’s not. In today’s post, I want to address what is minimalism.

          Less is more
        </h2>
        <p>
          Like simple living, it’s important to have a clear vision of what a simple, minimalist lifestyle means to you. Although minimalism is as much about the journey as it is the end goal, without having a clear goal of what you want minimalism to look like in your life, it’s hard to stay focused and on track. This perfectly describes minimalism.
